    <p> My module 3! Today I'm working on input and output within a terminal. Basically input and output is something
    that happens when a certain command asks you to enter info, and then prints out something based on what you have entered.
     To get the certain info to print out you need command line arguments. These are certain lines of code that have sets of
    things to print to the terminal based on what you input.<p/>
