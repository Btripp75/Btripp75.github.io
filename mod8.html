    <h1>Welcome to MODULE 8</h1>
    <p> I have been shown a website known as FreeCodeCamp this week. I really like the site and find it very useful.
      It is showing me a lot of Css so I can now style things how I want. Even after this class ends, I still feel that I will 
      continue using this website to expand my knowledge of coding.
