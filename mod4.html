    <h1> Mod 4! </h1>
  <p>  Ayeeee its module 4! So far I have been working on Arithmetic evaluations that can be solved within bash. I have realized
    there is many different ways to do an equation in bash. You could either write them out line by line or surround your
    script with parenthesis. There are many different commands to equal the same thing also, for example == means equals but
    so does ===
